# Some weeks are missing where are they?

I didn't keep track of week 1 and week 2.

# What about week 6?

Check [the announcement](/ANNOUNCEMENT.md).

# What will happen now?

I will add those weeks if I can find someone who remembers the questions.
I lost my versions, so if I can find the questions, I will have to resolve
them. Previously there was a Copilot version of week 6, that exact solution is
now completely gone. Sorry.
